                <p>Since I was six years old I joined a football team. And still play to this very day.
                  The thrill of the game and the potential to achieve certain goals while working with a
                  team is very satisfiying. Also the strong friendships that emerge from team sports are
                  precious.</p>

                <p>Technology is the future. It will advance humankind, it brought us to the moon
                  and back. It marvels me how much a cellphone is capable of doing. And with
                  coding I can be part of this. Creating a project that could help or inform
                  someone. The ability to create gives the ability to change. </p>

                <p>Exploring the many places our world has to offer really
                  feeds my wanderlust. The different cultures and natural phenomenals
                  made my frequent travels very memorable. From walking to Santiago de Compostella,
                  or traveling very local in Albania and Iceland. While working in countries such
                  as South-Africa, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and New-Zealand gave me a lot of experience.
                  And trying the many local recipes I learned while traveling is an extra bonus.
                  As it's a good way to recall excellent memories.</p>

                <p>While growing up gaming has been an ever-present activity in my life.
                   First with my brothers at home, or on our annual roadtrip to Spain. The frequency
                   of playing has dropped somewhat throughout the years. But my friends and me
                   still play together. It's a great way to keep in touch and to meet new people.
                   Furthermore I have always been interested by the internal workings off the
                   games I played. It's also here that my interest in coding began, by modifying
                   small parts of the game.</p>
